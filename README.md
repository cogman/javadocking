This is a fork of the javadocking framework.  It appears that the current repo is unmaintained.

This library has been modified to allow for usage with Java 9+.  It would previously fail because the version tracking assumed java 6 and below.

# Usage

To use this library, add the following maven dependency to your pom file

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.cogman</groupId>
      <artifactId>javadocking</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
